# Week-4-HW
Jordan Goodrick's Week 4 HW
Analysis:
The type of the school is a heavy indicator of its overall pass rate. Charter schools tend to have much higher overall pass rates, as well as higher average scores than district schools do. Additionally, large schools(2000-5000 students) tend to have a lower overall passing rate than both small and medium sized schools. Finally, as spending per student increases, overall passing rate decreases.
